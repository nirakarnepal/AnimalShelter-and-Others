QUESTION: After threading is added to threads.cpp, is the order of prime numbers found in primes_threads.txt the same or different than in primes.txt?  Why?


QUESTION: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?


QUESTION: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
